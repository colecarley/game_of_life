# GAME OF LIFE

## Description
This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java. The Game of Life is a zero-player game based on cellular automaton. The result of the game is based on the initial state of the cells, which are generated randomly. The game is played on a 2D grid, where each cell can be either alive or dead. The game follows the following rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.


## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run the Driver class


You can then just sit back and watch the cells evolve.

## Motivation
I always thought the Game of Life was a cool concept, so I decided to try and implement it myself. I have never written anything substantial in Java, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn the language.
